Implementation of the data structures I've learned so far from CS 131, CS 301, and [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P). Textbook used: [Data Structures and Algorithms in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/0470383275).

The data strucutres:
- [x] Extendable Vector
- [x] Singly Linked list
- [x] Doubly linked list
- [x] Stack
- [x] Queue
- [x] Binary Search Tree
- [x] AVL Tree
- [x] Graph
